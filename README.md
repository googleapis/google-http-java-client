# Google HTTP Client Library for Java

## Description
Written by Google, the Google HTTP Client Library for Java is a flexible, efficient, and powerful
Java library for accessing any resource on the web via HTTP. The library has the following
features:

- Pluggable HTTP transport abstraction that allows you to use any low-level library such as
java.net.HttpURLConnection, Apache HTTP Client, or URL Fetch on Google App Engine.
- Efficient JSON and XML data models for parsing and serialization of HTTP response and request
content. The JSON and XML libraries are also fully pluggable, and they include support for
[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) and Android's GSON libraries for JSON.

The library supports the following Java environments:

- Java 6 (or higher)
- Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) (or higher)
- GoogleAppEngine Google App Engine

The following related projects are built on the Google HTTP Client Library for Java:

- [Google OAuth Client Library for Java](https://github.com/google/google-oauth-java-client),
for the OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0a authorization standards.
- [Google APIs Client Library for Java](https://github.com/google/google-api-java-client), for
access to Google APIs.

This is an open-source library, and
