# Google HTTP Client Library for Java

## Description
Written by Google, the Google HTTP Client Library for Java is a flexible, efficient, and powerful Java library for accessing any resource on the web via HTTP. The library has the following features:
  - Pluggable HTTP transport abstraction that allows you to use any low-level library such as java.net.HttpURLConnection, Apache HTTP Client, or URL Fetch on Google App Engine.
  - Efficient JSON and XML data models for parsing and serialization of HTTP response and request content.  The JSON and XML libraries are also fully pluggable, and they include support for [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) and Android's GSON libraries for JSON.

The library supports the following Java environments:
  - Java 5 (or higher), standard (SE) and enterprise (EE)
  - Android Android 1.5 (or higher)
  - GoogleAppEngine Google App Engine

The following related projects  are built on the Google HTTP Client Library for Java:
  - [Google OAuth Client Library for Java](https://github.com/google/google-oauth-java-client), for the OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0a authorization standards.
  - [Google APIs Client Library for Java](https://github.com/google/google-api-java-client), for access to Google APIs.

This is an open-source library, and [contributions](https://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/wiki/BecomingAContributor) are welcome.
