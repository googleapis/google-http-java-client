/**
 * Interface which handles abnormal HTTP responses (in other words not 2XX).
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, this might be used to refresh an OAuth 2 token:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
  public static class RefreshTokenHandler implements HttpUnsuccessfulResponseHandler {
    public boolean handleResponse(
        HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response, boolean retrySupported) throws IOException {
      if (response.statusCode == HttpStatusCodes.STATUS_CODE_UNAUTHORIZED) {
        refreshToken();
      }
      return false;
    }
  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sample usage with a request factory:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
  public static HttpRequestFactory createRequestFactory(HttpTransport transport) {
    final RefreshTokenHandler handler = new RefreshTokenHandler();
    return transport.createRequestFactory(new HttpRequestInitializer() {
      public void initialize(HttpRequest request) {
        request.unsuccessfulResponseHandler = handler;
      }
    });
  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you have a custom unsuccessful response handler, use this more complex example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
  public static HttpRequestFactory createRequestFactory(HttpTransport transport) {
    final RefreshTokenHandler handler = new RefreshTokenHandler();
    return transport.createRequestFactory(new HttpRequestInitializer() {
      public void initialize(HttpRequest request) {
        request.unsuccessfulResponseHandler = new HttpUnsuccessfulResponseHandler() {
          public boolean handleResponse(
              HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response, boolean retrySupported)
              throws IOException {
            return handler.handleResponse(request, response, retrySupported);
          }
        };
      }
    });
  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations should normally be thread-safe.
 * </p>

   *        after they handle their event (e.g. a handler that implements exponential backoff).
