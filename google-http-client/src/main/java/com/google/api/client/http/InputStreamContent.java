/**
 * Concrete implementation of {@link AbstractInputStreamContent} that simply handles the transfer of
 * data from an input stream to an output stream. This should only be used for streams that can not
 * be re-opened and retried. If you have a stream that it is possible to recreate please create a
 * new subclass of {@link AbstractInputStreamContent}.
 *
 * <p>The input stream is guaranteed to be closed at the end of {@link #writeTo(OutputStream)}.
 *
 * <p>Sample use with a URL:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * private static void setRequestJpegContent(HttpRequest request, URL jpegUrl) throws IOException {
 * request.setContent(new InputStreamContent("image/jpeg", jpegUrl.openStream()));
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Implementation is not thread-safe.
