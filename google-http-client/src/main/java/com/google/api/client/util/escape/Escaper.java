/**
 * An object that converts literal text into a format safe for inclusion in a particular context
 * (such as an XML document). Typically (but not always), the inverse process of "unescaping" the
 * text is performed automatically by the relevant parser.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, an XML escaper would convert the literal string {@code "Foo<Bar>"} into {@code
 * "Foo&lt;Bar&gt;"} to prevent {@code "<Bar>"} from being confused with an XML tag. When the
 * resulting XML document is parsed, the parser API will return this text as the original literal
 * string {@code "Foo<Bar>"}.
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@code Escaper} instance is required to be stateless, and safe when used concurrently by
 * multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>
 * Several popular escapers are defined as constants in the class {@link CharEscapers}.
