/**
 * Thread-safe abstract HTTP transport.
 *
 * <p>Implementation is thread-safe, and subclasses must be thread-safe. For maximum efficiency,
 * applications should use a single globally-shared instance of the HTTP transport.
 *
 * <p>The recommended concrete implementation HTTP transport library to use depends on what
 * environment you are running in:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Google App Engine: use {@code
 *       com.google.api.client.extensions.appengine.http.UrlFetchTransport}.
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>{@code com.google.api.client.apache.ApacheHttpTransport} doesn't work on App Engine
 *             because the Apache HTTP Client opens its own sockets (though in theory there are ways
 *             to hack it to work on App Engine that might work).
 *         <li>{@code com.google.api.client.javanet.NetHttpTransport} is discouraged due to a bug in
 *             the App Engine SDK itself in how it parses HTTP headers in the response.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>Android:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>For maximum backwards compatibility with older SDK's use {@code
 *             newCompatibleTransport} from {@code
 *             com.google.api.client.extensions.android.http.AndroidHttp} (read its JavaDoc for
 *             details).
 *         <li>If your application is targeting Gingerbread (SDK 2.3) or higher, simply use {@code
 *             com.google.api.client.javanet.NetHttpTransport}.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>Other Java environments
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>{@code com.google.api.client.googleapis.javanet.GoogleNetHttpTransport} is included
 *             in google-api-cient 1.22.0, so easy to include.
 *         <li>{@code com.google.api.client.javanet.NetHttpTransport} is based on the
 *             HttpURLConnection built into the Java SDK, so it used to be the preferred choice.
 *         <li>{@code com.google.api.client.apache.ApacheHttpTransport} is a good choice for users
 *             of the Apache HTTP Client, especially if you need some of the configuration options
 *             available in that library.
 *       </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Some HTTP transports do not support all HTTP methods. Use {@link #supportsMethod(String)} to
 * check if a certain HTTP method is supported. Calling {@link #buildRequest()} on a method that is
 * not supported will result in an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses should override {@link #supportsMethod(String)} and {@link #buildRequest(String,
 * String)} to build requests and specify which HTTP methods are supported.
